### Problem statement

Accept 2 numbers from the user as input and output the following:
   * Sum
   * Difference
   * Product
   * and the largest number of the two

## Getting started

This boiler plate works if you have [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org), [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](http://npmjs.com) installed.

The ```main.c``` is the entry point of the application and the name ```main.c``` should not be changed because it the name that is recognised in the build scripts. However if you wish to change the name also update scripts in ```package.json``` for the program to continue working as expected.

### How to run

So in the terminal run the following:

**To compile**
```bash
  $ npm run build
```

**To run the compiled program**
```bash
  $ npm run run
```

**To compile and run using one command**
```bash
  $ npm run dev
```
